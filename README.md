# 🏦 Bankist App

A modern banking simulation web app built with **vanilla JavaScript**.
It allows users to log in, transfer money, request loans, close accounts, and view transactions with localized dates and currencies. 
This project was created **for practice purposes**, mainly to improve skills in:
- DOM manipulation
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `sort`, etc.)
- Internationalization API (`Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `Intl.NumberFormat`)
- Timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)
- Event handling

## 🚀 Features

🔐 User Authentication – Login with username & PIN

💸 Money Transfers – Send money to other accounts

🏦 Loan Requests – Request loans with conditions

❌ Close Account – Permanently delete an account

📊 Transaction History – View deposits & withdrawals with dates

🌍 Internationalization (i18n) – Dates & currencies formatted based on locale

⏳ Auto Logout Timer – User is logged out after inactivity

🔄 Sorting – Sort transactions ascending/descending
